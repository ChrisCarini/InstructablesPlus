Instructables+ - A Google Chrome Extension
==============================


## About ##
Instructables+ is a script that I have writen so people are able to view all the steps on an Instructable.
The script detects when you visit an Instructable page and redirects you to the page that shows all of the steps for that Instructable.

I primarily made this so I would not have to manually type "?ALLSTEPS" at the end of the URI when opening Instrustables from their emails.

## Installation Instructions ##

1. Click [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instructables%20/aahehhoaebjhnmploicennmcopefepii)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Enjoy!
